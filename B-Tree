multiway trees:

m-way trees

B-tree : BST : ordered tree/ascending tree

Insertion
m b-tree: m = order= 3, m-1 = 2
insert 1 to 10

Leaf nodes are at the same level

Deletion in B-Tree: 

1. if target key is in leaf node.
2. if target key is in internal node.

order , m = 5

min children = [m/2] = 2.5 = 3
max children = 5

min keys = [m/2] - 1 = 2
max keys = 4 = m-1

leaf node

1. That leaf node contains more than min. no of keys.
2. That leaf node contains min. no. of keys.
	a.) borrow from immediate left node(sibling)
	b.) borrow from immediate right node (sibling)
	c.) left node or right node--> parent node -->merge

Internal node:

	a.) Inorder Predeccessor
	b.) Inorder Successor
	c.) Merge with sibling but the help of parent node
